Description:
This project aims to analyze the performance of students based on various demographic and academic factors. The dataset used contains information about students' demographic attributes such as gender, ethnicity, parent's education, marital status, as well as academic scores in math, reading, and writing.

Tools Used:
Python
Libraries: NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Steps Taken:
Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

Loaded the dataset (students_score.csv) using pandas.
Explored the structure of the dataset, including column names, data types, and missing values.
Cleaned the data by handling missing values and removing unnecessary columns (Unnamed: 0).
Data Analysis:

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using descriptive statistics and visualization techniques.
Visualized the distribution of student demographics, such as gender and ethnicity, using count plots and pie charts.
Analyzed the relationship between parent's education, marital status, and student's academic scores using heatmap visualizations and statistical analysis.
Insights Obtained:

Identified patterns and trends in student performance based on demographic factors.
Examined the impact of parent's education and marital status on student academic achievement.
Visualized the distribution of ethnic groups among students and analyzed their performance.
Key Findings:
Gender Distribution: The dataset contains more female students than male students.
Parent's Education: Students with parents holding master's degrees tend to have higher average scores compared to other education levels.
Marital Status: There is no significant impact on student performance based on parent's marital status.
Ethnic Groups: The dataset includes students from various ethnic groups, with the majority belonging to groups C and D.
Conclusion:
This project provides insights into student performance based on demographic attributes and academic scores. Further analysis can be conducted to explore additional factors influencing student achievement and to provide recommendations for educational policies and interventions.
