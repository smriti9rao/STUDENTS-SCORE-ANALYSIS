  **STUDENTS RESULT ANALYSIS**
**Overview**:
This project aims to analyze the performance of students based on various demographic and academic factors. It involves exploring a dataset containing information about students' demographic attributes and academic scores in math, reading, and writing.

**Tools Used**:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Steps Taken**:
Data Preprocessing:
Loaded the dataset (students_score.csv) using pandas.
Explored the dataset's structure and handled missing values.
Removed unnecessary columns (Unnamed: 0).

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
Conducted EDA to understand the distribution of demographic attributes and academic scores.
Visualized demographic characteristics such as gender and ethnicity using count plots and pie charts.
Analyzed the relationship between parent's education, marital status, and student academic scores using heatmap visualizations and statistical analysis.

**Key Findings**:
Gender Distribution: The dataset contains more female students than male students.
Parent's Education: Students with parents holding master's degrees tend to have higher average scores compared to other education levels.
Marital Status: There is no significant impact on student performance based on parent's marital status.
Ethnic Groups: The dataset includes students from various ethnic groups, with the majority belonging to groups C and D.

**Conclusion**:
This project provides insights into student performance based on demographic attributes and academic scores.
Further analysis can be conducted to explore additional factors influencing student achievement and to provide recommendations for educational policies and interventions.
